        ,
            1 Cake Tin
        ,Pour 1 carton of milk (~1 liter) into a large pot and heat it up.
                                                                                    ,Meanwhile in a small bowl, mix in the cocoa powder, the sugar and a bit of vanilla extract and pour in about 100 ml's of milk and combine well.
Don’t worry about the lumps, they will dissolve once heated.
                                                                                    ,Next, add this mixture into the milk in the pot and let it boil and thicken over a medium flame.
                                                                                    ,Once the mixture has come to a boil, add in the chocolate chips and let the whole thing thicken. Basically you are looking for a chocolate sauce consistency.
                                                                                    ,There’s only one drawback in this recipe as compared to the icing sugar and butter method – this takes time. But we all know things that take time always taste good, right?
                                                                                    ,Remember to use a large enough pot as this mixture is prone to boil over as it thickens. To prevent this from happening, I always keep a wooden spoon over it plus reduce the heat when it threatens to boil over.
                                                                                    ,Once the chocolate mixture comes to a saucy consistency, add in a knob of butter (salted, unsalted – whatever; I am not particular and whatever is in the fridge works just fine). The butter will help the sauce to achieve a glossy sheen.
                                                                                    ,Once the sauce is done, remove from heat and set aside.
                                                                                    ,Now add the rest of the milk into a deep dish and soak some of the Marie biscuits in it. But don’t do this too early or you might end up with a milk-biscuit cereal.
                                                                                    ,What you hope to achieve is biscuits that are semi soft but with a little bit of bite, about one minute max. I would advise to do this step in batches.
                                                                                    ,Once the first batch is done, you could layer biscuits into your cake tray/ dessert dish/ bowl/jar and set aside. Overlaps are fine.
                                                                                    ,Then pour in a layer of the chocolate sauce, followed by another layer of soaked biscuits and sauce and so on. Remember to ensure that the last layer is chocolate sauce.
                                                                                    ,You could get creative at this point and add canned pineapples, cherries, a bit of brandy, cashew nuts or whatnot in between the layers for added flavors and textures, but I like to keep mine purely chocolaty.
                                                                                    ,Next let it cool down and pop into the fridge for a few hours to chill and set. Cut into squares/ rectangles or just scoop a huge portion out and serve. Some would dust a bit of icing sugar, berries, cashew or even serve with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

        ,First off, you'll have to blend your crackers. Put them in the processor and blitz them up until they turn into a bread-crumb like consistency.
                                                                                    ,To your bowl, add the minced beef, parsley, oregano, salt, pepper, egg and the crushed Komé crackers.
                                                                                    ,Use your hands to mix all these ingredients until they're fully incorporated.
                                                                                    ,Pick up little portions of the minced meat mix and flatten them with your palms like little pancakes. Place a cube of Mozzarella cheese in the middle, and mould into a meatball. Repeat until you're all out of meat and cheese.
                                                                                    ,Fry in oil until it's cooked through. Careful though- don't over-fry because that'll make the cheese ooze out and you'll be left with a sad heap of meat and cheese.
                                                                                    ,Serve however you like. Send us a picture.

        ,First of all, take your Lemon Puff biscuits, and scoop out the cream. This cream, will be used in the batter later, so make sure you store it in the meantime.
                                                                                    ,Add 1 and 1/2 tablespoons of butter
